The Inverted Index can be understood as a simple key/value dictionary where per each term we store a list of appearances of those terms in the documents and their frequency.<br>
The Database class is a fake in-memory DB used to persist the documents after they have been indexed.<br>
In order to test the execution of the index, I just create a couple documents and perform some searches.<br>
